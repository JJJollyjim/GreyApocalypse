				<p><b><u>How to play:</u></b></p>
				
				<p>
					Grey Apocalypse is a programming game. This means that two players have to write programs in the GA programming language.<br />
					The grey box above is the memory of a simulated computer. When you click on the "Start" button, the game will start, the two programs will be loaded<br />
					and executed. A game of GA consists of two rounds. In round 1, program 1 will be white, and program 2 will be black. White always goes first.<br />
					In round 2, the two programs will be swapped. The goal of the game for the white program is to make the "memory" as white as possible, while the black<br />
					program tries to make the memory as dark as possible. Programs can do this using the commands described below.<br />
					There are two example programs available that are loaded by default. You can just press the "Start" button without doing anything else<br />
					to see those two programs in action!
				</p>
				
				<br />
				
				<p><b><u>Overview of Commands:</u></b></p>
				
				<p>
					<b>+</b>: This command increases the value of the current memory cell.<br />
					For the white program, this will make the current memory cell lighter. If this command is run from the black program, the cell will be made darker.<br />
					<p class="advancedhelp">
						Advanced usage: When a memory cell is 50% grey (the default colour), the <b>+</b> command will be most effective.<br />
						When a memory cell is almost completely white or black, the <b>+</b> command is less effective.<br />
						Then, it will only increase the value roughly a sixth of what is would increase by if the colour was grey instead of almost completely white or black.<br />
						Therefore, it is much more efficient to use the <b>+</b> command when the colour of the current memory cell is as close to grey as possible.
					</p>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>=</b>: This command sets the value of the current memory cell to the average of the surrounding cells.<br />
					<p class="advancedhelp">
						Advanced usage: This command gets the values of the four surrounding cells.<br />
						The value that is "worst" for the current program is removed, and the average of the remaining three values will be the new value of the current memory cell.<br />
						For the white program, the value that will be removed is the darkest value, and the black program will remove the lightest value.
					</p>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>^</b>: This command moves the program up one memory cell.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>v</b>: This command moves the program down.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>&lt;</b>: This command moves the program left.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>&gt;</b>: This command moves the program right.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>.</b>: This command does nothing (no-op).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>infinite { </b><i><u>commands</u></i><b> }</b>: This is an infinite loop. All <i><u>commands</u></i> inside it are run infinitely.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>repeat (</b><i><u>number</u></i><b>) { </b><i><u>commands</u></i><b> }</b>: 
					This is a loop that runs its <i><u>commands</u></i> a certain number of times.<br />
					The <i><u>number</u></i> entered in brackets shows how often the commands should be repeated.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>while (</b><a class="helpref" href="#conditionHelp">condition</a><b>) { </b><i><u>commands</u></i><b> }</b>: 
					This is a loop that runs its <i><u>commands</u></i> <b>while</b> a certain <a class="helpref" href="#conditionHelp">condition</a> is true.
					<p class="advancedhelp">
						Advanced usage: Every while loop will store the current x and y coordinates when entering the loop and retrieve the memory value <br />
						from that position instead of using the current value as the program may have moved in the meantime.
					</p>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>if (</b><a class="helpref" href="#conditionHelp">condition</a><b>) { </b><i><u>commands</u></i><b> }</b>: 
					An <b>if</b> statement will only run its <i><u>commands</u></i> <b>if</b> certain <i><u>condition</u></i> is true.
				</p>

				<p id="conditionHelp">
					Conditions: A <i><u>condition</u></i> always consists of a comparator (greater than (&gt;) or less than (&lt;)) and a number.<br />
					For example, &gt;5 is a valid condition.<br />
					Conditions always compare the value of the current memory cell with the specified number.<br />
					In this example, the loop would run its commands <b>while</b> the value of the current memory cell is <b>greater than</b> 5.<br />
					Values of memory range from 0 to 255, with 255 being best and 0 being worst.<br />
					Therefore, using a condition like <b>&lt;250</b> in a <b>while</b> loop will loop <b>while</b> the value of the current memory cell is less than 250.
